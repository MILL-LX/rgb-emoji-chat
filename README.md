## Set up the Pi

### OS

This project has been developed on a Raspberry Pi 3 running *Bullseye - light* with SSH enabled and a public key installed. Installing the public key will make your life easier if you like to use the VSCode Remote SSH plugin to develop directly on the Pi.

### Tooling

sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

sudo apt install \
    git \
